# Ultimate-Export

For you lot ubers that wanted export import.. We made one! now the thing is that this is still being tested by us and will be open for all ubers

known issues:
noticed that there is a issue with upvalues so sometimes this can break (say re and execute, repeat it until it works, plus not sure if its synapse x or something)

Any users that use this script for trolling/greifing/etc will be reported and possibly banned you've been warned!

loadstrings:
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JunglePush/Ultimate-Export/main/Export%20Tool'))() -- export tool
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JunglePush/Ultimate-Export/main/AutoBuild'))() -- import
/\ the import tool is deprecated. INSTEAD do loadfile("Properties.txt")()

these can keep you up to date!
